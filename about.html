	<h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>I hold a fat assssssssssssssssss Computational Neuroscience MSc from the Bernstein Cenner for for Computational Neuroscience Berlin and a Psychology BA from New York University.<br /><br />

  I have extensive experience in clinical research, study design, advanced statistics, harm reduction, neuroimaging analysis, signal processing, software development, psychedelic science, and machine learning.<br /><br />

  I've worked to build brain computer interfaces, model mechanisms underling visual hallucinations, look for the biological substrates of personality, and understand neural events that may underlie near death experiences.<br /><br />

  My research across neurology, psychology, and psychiatry attempts to answer: "How can we understand what someone is experiencing? And with that knowledge, how can help that person heal?"<br /><br />

  When I'm not researching, I look for answers those questions for through dance, making music, and cooking for friends.<br /><br />

  If you'd like to work with me on a project, shoot me a message.</p>

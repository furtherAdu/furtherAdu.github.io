## Notes for Rita
(Nov 10, 2022)
- Experience section should have title of project, organization, and date in one column (right-indented), and the project description in another columns (left indented)
- The titles should be right-indented when image is on the right, and the same for left
- Tags should have border and font the same color, with the background being brighter
